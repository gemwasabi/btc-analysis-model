Then once they did buy, they will have to be audited in Q1 '26 for their annual report. The auditor would have to check the BTC as well. Strategy uses a Big 4 firm which is very strong, imo.

Trump Media, well... they went with a smaller firm this year after their previous auditor got [closed down](https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/firm-sues-bdo-alliance-after-ouster) by the SEC (accused of a massive fraud and fined $14m.) Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital will provide custody for Trump Media. IMO it would be still quite the conspiracy for all of them to not have the BTC at all once they purchased it, so I still don't expect that at all."

If they had a million dollar loan, secured with cash, that they used to buy bitcoin, the movement of the investment would be detached from the collateral (their credit). BTC can collapse 50%, and all they want is continued payments. If you can’t service the loan, sell before you’re negative. 😂

Few Crypto friend countries and places you can cash out your crypto too with not much issue, I think HongKong has a lot of none KYC exchange booths. 

I would look at cashing some of your BTC out where you are in the US if possible, unless you have cash already and bring the max $ you can travel with which is $10,000 I believe, so you have a decent run way. That can last anywhere from 4-6 months or longer depending on your lifestyle.

2025-06-06T13:03:00,0.9496,"For an asset that more or less steadily appreciates in value, like the S&P500 over the last 15 years, lump sum is the best option. For an asset with a high volatility,  that can go down 70% or up 100% within a few months, lump sum is more risky. Could you live with Bitcoin going to 50k if you invest everything now? If it will reach 150k this year, lump sum now would be a good option. Problem is know one knows. DCA is the safer option for high volatility assets. It depends on your risk appetite."

You pay for that leverage, in the case of perpetuals through the funding rate. Last time I checked they were like 12% annualized, so putting the other 19k in money market for 4-5% nets you a loss.

In contrast, you have 20-25% margin typically (which is leverage of 4-5x). But the financing rates are usually much lower.

2025-06-06T11:52:25,0.9523,"No. 

Crypto as a system being free is important, not that individual assets on the blockchains always must be decentralized. 

Just think of real estate. As long as countries have authority over their own land, you cannot manage real estate ownership without a connection to that centralized ownership system.

But a global blockchain handling real estate in all countries, that no individual government could individually change, would still be decentralized.

There needs to be a separation between the owners of the blockchain and the owners of the assets controlled by the blockchain, at least in the global markets.

You could still tie centralized blockchains into a global decentralized system via tokenization/bridging and in some cases that even makes sense. Especially when the real world asset that is handled on the blockchain is centralized itself. 

Which is also why a FED-issued USD stable-coin would make sense, since the FED are the primary authority giving out USD. It's just pointless to have a FED-USD only chain that does not interact with anything else. If you can move those FED-backed USD around other blockchains to buy things, with it being accepted because the FED backs its value with the same means it backs the value of a paper-bill, it would be equally trustworthy. 

And if the transfer is separated from the issuance and backing of that stable-coin, all the fears of government spying on the people would dissolve, since the transfer would not be centrally controlled by the government."
2025-06-06T11:51:16,0.9921,"When picking a crypto exchange, there are a few key things to look at. One of the first is security. You want to make sure the exchange has good protection for your funds, like strong encryption and ways to keep your account safe.

Another thing is how easy it is to use. Some exchanges have simpler interfaces that are great for beginners, while others might have more advanced tools for experienced traders. The fees are also important because they can eat into your profits if you’re not careful.

You also want to look at what coins the exchange offers. Some have a huge range, while others might just stick to the big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

As for choosing between a CEX (Centralized Exchange) and a DEX (Decentralized Exchange), it really depends. A CEX is usually easier to use and faster, which is why most beginners start there. A DEX gives you more control and privacy, but it can be more complicated.

LMFX has a crypto exchange that works more like a CEX, which makes it easier for newcomers to get started. Plus, LMFX has their own token, LMGX, trading on BitMart, which shows they’re serious about crypto. If you’re just starting out, using a centralized exchange like the one at LMFX can be a good first step before exploring more complex DEX options.

Overall, just make sure you understand the basics, check out the fees, and pick an exchange that feels safe and straightforward to use. You’ll learn more as you go, and you can always switch things up later when you’re more confident."

Jesus warns in the Bible that many people will pretend to be him, wherein there will be many false messiahs and false prophets who will lead people astray. (Matthew 24:23-24, Mark 13:21-22) how does she truly know that this guy isn't one of them?

In the Bible, when people try to offer buying the power of God, where they want to trade their money for his power the Christians clearly rebuke that offer and attitude. See Simon the Sorcerer in The Book of Acts. So Jesus would never trade his free gifts for money.

Why does she want this to be true? According to the New Testamant, people are saved by grace alone. Ephesians 4:2-5 and other passages. So she can't try and 'save' her late husband by offering someone money. You can't buy your way into the afterlife. That belief clearly isn't Christian.

Just some thoughts. I can offer more if you'd like. I hope that helps.

Peace."

Bitcoin split over this in 2017. BTC has to have high fees, because the blocksize is limited. BitcoinCash did not limit the blocksize it can pay the reward with many small fee tx.

>BTC dominance will never reach 100% again as much as we may want it to as long as we live in a free market society, anyone can create their own dogshit shitcoins or BTC copycats.

Likely the interesting bit is, that ""shitcoins"" existed before 2017 and Bitcoin still had nearly 100%. It was only after the blocksize war, than BTC lost  a ton of dominance. I don't know which value you would aim for, I don't think it has anything to do with health. It's just another way of measuring price."

2025-06-06T08:57:51,0.9951,"**Read this text to understand the difference between Bitcoin and crypto-fiat.**

Throughout history, many goods have come and gone as forms of money. Unfortunately, when one form of money is discontinued, sometimes a group of people exploits another form by manipulating that money.

Let’s look at a hypothetical village called Newtonia to understand how this exploitation happens.

**Green Beads Become Money**  
For hundreds of years, the villagers of Newtonia collected green beads from the nearby river. The beads were small, light, durable, uniform, and rarely found in the river. People first desired the beads because of their beauty. Eventually, the villagers realized everyone wanted the beads—they could be easily sold. The beads soon became the medium of exchange and unit of account in the village: a chicken cost 5 beads, a sack of apples 2 beads, a cow 80 beads.

The total supply of beads was fairly constant, and prices didn’t change much over time. The village elder believed he could relax in his final days, living off his large stockpile of beads.

**The Alchemist Creates More Beads**  
The village alchemist wanted to be wealthy but disliked hard work. Instead of searching for beads in the river or trading valuable goods, he stayed in his lab. Eventually, he discovered how to easily create hundreds of beads using just some sand and fire.

Villagers searching for beads in the river were happy to find one bead a day. The alchemist could produce hundreds with little effort.

**The Alchemist Spends His Beads**  
Being quite cunning, the alchemist kept his bead-making method secret. He created even more beads and began spending them on goods in Newtonia’s market. Over the next months, he bought a chicken farm, several cows, fine silk, bedding, and a large estate. He was able to purchase these goods at normal market prices.

The alchemist’s spending left the villagers with many beads but little valuable goods.

Everyone felt wealthy—they had tons of beads! However, they slowly noticed that everyone else also had tons of beads.

**Prices Begin to Rise**  
The chicken farmer noticed that all the goods he wanted to buy at the market became more expensive. A sack of apples now sold for 100 beads—50 times the price from a few months earlier!

Even though he now had thousands of beads, he soon feared running out due to these prices. He wondered—could he really afford to sell his chickens for only 5 beads each? He had to raise his prices as well.

Simply put, as a result of the alchemist’s spending of his newly created beads, there were too many beads chasing too few goods—so prices rose.

Buyers were willing to spend more beads to get the goods they needed. Sellers needed to charge more to make sure they earned enough to buy necessary goods for themselves.

Since prices of all goods increased, we can say that the value of each bead decreased.

**Wealth Inequality Grows**  
The village elder, who worked hard to save thousands of beads, now found himself poor and hungry. Meanwhile, the alchemist comfortably sat on his large estate with cows, chickens, and servants attending to his every whim.

The alchemist effectively stole the wealth of the entire village by cheaply producing beads and using them to buy valuable goods.

Most importantly, he bought goods before the market realized there were more beads in circulation and fewer goods available, which caused prices to rise. This extra bead production didn’t add useful goods or services to the village."

2025-06-06T08:23:36,0.73,"Market cap is such a weird metric. It doesn't say how much money has actually been put into a company, or even what it could be sold for if all their shares were suddenly dumped. It's just a snapshot of the most recent single stock price sold multiplied by the total shares outstanding, which aren't technically all equal to that at the same time...they'd probably sell for WAY less if someone tried to sell a lot all at once. So it's only a useful metric saying what a stock could sell for in reasonably small amounts only.

Even when private equity firms buy entire companies, they don't simply pay the market cap. The REAL valuation is based on other things like assets, liabilities, revenue streams, and other considerations.

I'm not saying a market cap doesn't have any value (categorization for risk assessment, guage of influence in the market, etc), just that at face value it's not the great metric so many people think it is. It's mostly an over-inflated illusion. Market caps are a TYPE of inflation."

Even the so-called 'strong' fiat currencies like the US dollar, euro, or Swiss franc lose 7–10% of their value annually. Others, like the Turkish lira or Argentine peso, are collapsing at triple-digit rates.

Short-term pumps of fiat currencies against Bitcoin  like the dollar  are possible, but they are not sustainable in the long run if you understand the underlying design and monetary policy. That’s why, instead of constantly tracking the price and trying to trade, it’s better to focus on long-term saving in Bitcoin  to convert your money into a hard form of money and protect yourself from inflation"

Why I think PEP actually has a chance at 100x

1. **PEP is a coin, not a token.** 
   * Around 99% of meme cryptocurrencies are tokens built on existing blockchains like Ethereum or Solana. PEP is a native coin with its own blockchain—like BTC, DOGE, and LTC.
2. **Only 2 meme** ***coins*** **are in the top 100 meme cryptos:** 
   * Dogecoin (#1) and Pepecoin (#100). The rest are all tokens. This makes PEP a real outlier and significantly more interesting long-term.
3. **Out of all pepe-themed projects, PEP is the only coin.** 
   * Everything else in the frog space is a token—PEP stands alone with its own chain.
4. **Still very early.** 
   * Launched January 30, 2024, it's still very much in its infancy, which means the upside potential is massive.
5. **Currently \~10x below its ATH.** 
   * Just returning to the ATH would be almost a 10x. That alone is a huge opportunity.
6. **Strong community + active dev team.** 
   * The subreddit and Discord are some of the most engaged I've seen, and the dev team is consistently building and active.
7. **THIS IS THE MAIN REASON I WAS CONVINCED TO BUY IN.** 
   * PEP is only listed on one Top-10 exchange (MEXC), and MEXC isn’t even available in the US or China—the two biggest crypto markets. Getting listed on more Top-10 exchanges isn’t an *if*, it’s a *when*. Once that happens, I believe PEP could potentially 10x beyond its ATH—nearly a 100x from where it is now.

**TL;DR:**  
PEP is one of only two meme *coins* (not tokens) in the top 100 meme cryptos. It’s early, undervalued, barely listed, has real upside potential, and a strong community + dev team behind it.

Similarly there might be a tiny fraction of stores that price their products in btc. But where I am, everything's in usd, and BTC value fluctuates dramatically... Which means I never know what anything is worth. The dollar may change, it may change a lot in a year, BTC changes even more for my actual use case.

Deflation isn't necessarily any better than inflation, especially if you're a vendor where suddenly that person's 1 sat can buy more than it used to.

The assertion that no nation-state will ever allow Bitcoin to replace its fiat currency is also overly simplistic.

The key isn't complete replacement, but rather navigating the potential benefits and risks of coexistence.

AI paste;

Bitcoin is highly popular in Turkey, driven by economic challenges like high inflation and the depreciation of the Turkish lira. According to a 2024 Statista survey, nearly 100% of respondents in Turkey were familiar with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, a significant rise from 16% in 2020. Data from HedgewithCrypto indicates that crypto adoption has surged, with around 40% of the population holding digital assets, making Turkey one of the top adopters globally. A KuCoin survey notes that 71% of Turkish crypto investors own Bitcoin, with 58% investing for long-term wealth accumulation and 37% using it as a hedge against inflation.The lira’s decline—losing over 50% of its value against the US dollar in recent years—has fueled interest in Bitcoin as a store of value and a speculative asset. Trading volumes reflect this: in 2024, the USDT-TRY pair on Binance saw over $22 billion in volume, far surpassing other pairs. Local exchanges like BtcTurk, Paribu, and Bitexen are widely used, with Binance leading due to its extensive offerings and Turkish lira support. Posts on X also highlight this trend, noting Bitcoin and USDT’s role in escaping inflation.Turkey’s crypto market is further supported by a young, tech-savvy population and a lack of restrictive regulations until recently, though new rules in 2025 impose stricter oversight, including mandatory licensing and identity verification. Despite this, Turkey ranks as the fourth-largest crypto market by transaction volume globally, ahead of many major economies."

2025-06-06T07:03:38,0.7184,"Interesting data, but let's temper the enthusiasm.  While the accumulation of 3.1% of the BTC supply by a new cohort in such a short timeframe is significant, it's crucial to consider the potential counter-arguments.  This could be a temporary surge driven by short-term speculation, rather than a long-term fundamental shift in market sentiment.


We need more data to assess the longevity of these holdings. Are these large institutional investors, or a wave of smaller retail investors?  The latter scenario might suggest greater volatility as these new holders react to market fluctuations.  Furthermore, the age of the coins (under six months) doesn't necessarily equate to conviction; a significant price drop could trigger a sell-off from this cohort.  Let's wait for further analysis before drawing definitive conclusions about a sustained bullish trend."

The previous bull runs you mentioned highlight shifts in narrative, not necessarily fundamental changes in the crypto landscape.


2017's ICO boom reflected early-stage investor enthusiasm, often lacking robust project fundamentals.  2021's NFT/meme craze showcased the power of community and virality, but also the potential for extreme volatility driven by speculative trading.


The next bull run will likely be driven by a confluence of factors:  adoption by institutional investors (driven by regulatory clarity and improved infrastructure), advancements in Layer-2 scaling solutions addressing network congestion, and the maturation of DeFi protocols offering genuinely innovative financial services.  We might see a narrative coalescing around these themes, rather than a single, easily-defined ""weird thing.""

2025-06-06T06:28:38,-0.902,"Sure, perpetual contracts are basically leveraged trading but it has no expiration date (unlike futures contracts).

Options on stocks and ETFs are very similar to perpetual contracts, but they have expirations on them, and options are by default leveraged at 100x.

If you know what/how options work, you can stop reading here.

In perpetual contracts, you borrow money to buy (or sell) Bitcoin, and when you sell your contract, you pay back to principle back. If you've seen any of the post about James Wynn lately about the 'crazy $1bn position', etc., that's basically perpetual contract. At one point, he borrowed 40x the amount, but that kind of leverage is very dangerous because (a) it only takes 2.5% of price movement to wipe that position out and (b) the more you borrow, the more interest you have to pay to keep the position open.

In the USA and few other countries (most of Canada too), leverage trading is either heavily limited or banned altogether.

2025-06-06T06:26:28,0.9783,"Interesting to see AI engaging in… creative competition.  While the rap battle itself is entertaining, it highlights a crucial aspect often overlooked in the crypto space:  the increasing role of AI in project development and community engagement.

This raises several points worth considering from a fundamental perspective.  First, the reliance on AI for community management: how robust is the underlying logic?  Is it truly engaging users organically, or is it following pre-programmed responses?  Transparency in this area is critical.


Second, the potential for AI to manipulate market sentiment. A sophisticated AI could potentially spread misinformation or artificially inflate engagement, thereby impacting token price.  Investors should be wary of projects heavily reliant on AI without rigorous auditing of their algorithms and data sources.  Ultimately, the value proposition of the underlying crypto project – its utility, tokenomics, and development team – still remains paramount.  The AI is a tool; it doesn't define the project's success or failure."

You misunderstand the logic.  But yes, risk transfer is more important to a healthy functioning economy than doctors and a healthy functioning economy is more important to a society than doctors.

True, that is endemic to the nature of economic risk (which is why risk transfer is so important)

>Buying a random cryptocurrency isn’t the same as taking on entrepreneurial risk to build a business or invent something new. 

It is exactly the same thing actually, given that most new business and inventions are also unlikely to contribute anything to an economy on a net basis.

>Meanwhile, doctors, teachers, engineers — they create consistent, tangible value every day that improves lives. Measuring contribution to society solely by willingness to absorb risk turns value creation into a lottery, not a meritocracy.

No I'm not.

I'm replying to your claim

> Why would someone born today want to buy a coin for 100k when some asshat holds 5% of it.

Which is saying, why would someone buy something where someone else (an asshat) holds 5% of it.

And I'm pointing out that people buy assets where asshats hold 5% of it **all the time**.

And with bitcoin, owning bitcoin gives you NO power in bitcoin's future.  All you can do is affect the market.

But with many of these other assets, owning 5% GIVES you power.  Like you said...

> voting power

So if an asshat owns 5% (or often more) AND they get voting power that would be much more powerful than an asshat owning 5% of bitcoin where they get NO power.

> If one person has more numbers than everyone else, people will leave the system.

That clearly is not true as if that was true bitcoin wouldn't be at the price it is today (along with the massive adoption we've seen recently by companies and financial institutions)

People are working on making Bitcoin more secure as we speak. I'm confident Bitcoin will remain quantum-resistant longer than anyone reading this will live. One thing I find great comfort in is the fact that millions of qubits would be needed to crack the algorithms in a reasonable time-frame, while current machines only have hundreds.

2025-06-06T06:00:18,-0.4516,"Cuz QCs can't do jack shit.    

The sole purpose of QC is to raise FUD about crypto.   To make people afraid of relying on it to ensure their funds and privacy.   This is why they keep reminding us that in less than 10 years all of the collected encrypted internet traffic will be somehow amazingly decrypted and you will go to jail for downloading some shit on the net.

Any quantum physicist with an ounce of moral fortitude will explain how utterly infeasible QC is.   Its a glorified pipe dream being hyped through every portal.    They are actually claiming on many wiki pages that it already breaks RSA and ECC.    This is utter and complete BS. 

QC has never been able to factor any number greater than 21.  That is the legal drinking age,  i.e. 3x7 not 21 bits or bytes.    Try to understand how absolutely ludicrous and preposterous it is for them to make the claim that they can currently break RSA and ECC.

Those algos use numbers so huge they are greater than all the electrons in the known universe.   Your private key is more than the coordinates to a single grain of sand on a beach.   It is the coordinates to a molecule in a grain of sand on a specific beach on a specific planet in a specific galaxy somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space.     In other words, if you lose that key your crypto is gone baby gone.    More importantly it means that finding that key is literally impossible.   No QC will ever get even vaguely close to cracking either RSA or ECC.   This will NEVER happen.   

However, why waste a good scam?

The simple fact is, if a mining pool goes rogue, it would be noticeable and any member of that pool can easily switch to a different pool, mine alone, or simply turn their machine off.

The issue with mining pools (and just plain miners) isn't really the 51% attack or some extreme noticeable maliciousness....it's them controlling the blockchain over time to where the public slowly gets used to shenanigans where they pick and choose what goes in the block.  They slowly move the goal posts to what is seen as acceptable.  It would start slow and in a way has already started...."

2025-06-06T04:57:18,0.9733,"While a $330k block reward is certainly a significant win, framing this as a ""solo miner"" success is misleading.  The scale of rented hashpower (261 PH/s) indicates a substantial financial investment, far beyond the typical individual miner.  This highlights the evolving landscape of Bitcoin mining, where access to capital, rather than individual effort, increasingly determines success.


The probability of such a win, even with this level of hashpower, remains low. This event likely reflects more about the inherent volatility of mining returns than individual skill or luck.  It’s a high-stakes gamble, and the odds—while improved by the scale of investment—are still heavily weighted against profitability in the long run. The actual cost of renting that much hashpower for the duration needed to secure this block is crucial missing information.  Without that data, it's difficult to assess the true profitability of this venture."

You currently have a roughly 3% world wide investor belief, the goal is to make this the international currency IE 75 to 100% belief in it as a currency and I DOES NOT LOSE VALUE TO INFLATION. Bitcoin Infact gains gains value through inflation, by hedging against it. 


Everytime they print money the fiat becomes less value and increases the standing value of Bitcoin.... It doesn't reprint , they can't pay back their own debt by saying they made more. 


Those three factors of value are going to see this continue to increase in value, people just need to understand this is the true function of the product. 


Sick of inflation? Bitcoins are your one true ally. 


Pair all of this with ease of transfer , safe storage of wealth (ie doesn't default) and simplicity of liquidity and you've got the perfect investment vehicle. Dont worry, you're waaaaaay ahead of the curve , just keep your head down and keep believing in what is clearly a superior product.

BTC commerce peaked in 2017 and then steeply declined because of a massive fee event. which doesn't just mean it's expensive but also that there is a transaction backlog. not usable for commerce, and at the time lightning was 18 months away but here we are 8 years later and most lightning users are using custodial wallets connected to a few very-well connected lightning nodes because that's the only way lightning can work. the immense complexity required to solve these issues is just ridiculous in the face of a simple hard fork to increase the block size limit. consensus was there, it got broken by forum censorship across the main channels, and greed, as bitfinex picked the BTC chain to keep the ticker. you know this, and you're choosing to pick the wrong side of history.

and all this aside, BTC's security model is deeply flawed if it only cost you 1.60 with the current tx throughput. ""in 20 years \[2029\], Bitcoin will either have very large tx volume, or no tx volume""."

2025-06-06T04:24:10,0.921,"While the headline might seem incremental, JP Morgan's move to accept Bitcoin-linked ETFs as collateral is significant for institutional adoption.  It's not about immediate price impact, but rather a subtle shift in how traditional finance views Bitcoin's risk profile.  This legitimizes Bitcoin further within established financial systems, slowly but surely chipping away at the perception of it as a purely speculative asset.


The crucial question, as another commenter pointed out, is the *haircut* applied to these ETFs.  A lower haircut implies greater trust in the underlying Bitcoin price stability and the ETF's structure.  Data on this haircut will be key to understanding the actual risk assessment of JP Morgan and other potential adopters.  We'll need to watch for further announcements detailing those specifics to fully gauge the long-term ramifications."

2025-06-06T03:55:50,0.715,"Honestly for me it was just cash i had anyway so I figured I might as well put it in to something that pays interest. I was on the fence as to whether I was going to buy any or not. For ipos you submit an indication of interest and when the final pricing comes in you confirm if you still want the shares or not.  When the price came in at $85 it seemed worth it so I confirmed that I want the shares.  I’ll probably sell if the price appreciates much from here. It’s not going to become a core part of my holdings or anything. 

But if you are someone that owns STRF and you don’t think MSTR is in any danger of becoming insolvent you could switch to STRD. It has the same interest payment but will cost less because it is junior in the capital structure. Since it costs less you get a higher yield in exchange for taking on more risk than someone who owns STRF."

2025-06-06T03:52:04,0.8714,"The 80% churn rate isn't surprising, and likely reflects a broader issue with onboarding and user experience rather than inherent flaws in blockchain technology.  The ""get rich quick"" mentality certainly plays a role, as highlighted by other commenters.  However,  a significant portion of this statistic probably stems from poor user interfaces, complex transaction processes, and a lack of clear value propositions for casual users.  Many simply don't understand the underlying technology or the long-term potential, leading to disillusionment and abandonment after initial exploration.  Focusing on improving UX and creating more accessible, user-friendly interfaces could significantly impact user retention.

My bet is a mix of both (old cunts like me do get scammed), but I am sure the same is true for other types of banking.

Ah, but traditional banking is safer! They can get your money back if you get scammed! Yeah, I hear that, but my own bank couldn't get back a payment that THEY fucked up (not me), to the tune of $200K.... so I don't buy that story personally. Maybe others have had better outcomes.

2025-06-06T02:51:03,-0.829,"Automating trading strategies using AI is a fascinating area, but let's temper the enthusiasm with some realistic expectations.  While AI can process vast amounts of data faster than a human,  it's crucial to remember that even the most sophisticated models are still ultimately relying on past price action to predict future movements.  Crypto markets are notoriously volatile and influenced by factors – regulatory changes, macroeconomic events, social sentiment – that are difficult, if not impossible, for any AI to fully account for.


The ""visual cues"" you mention are likely indicators based on chart patterns, which themselves are not foolproof predictors.  Overfitting to historical data is a significant risk; an AI might perform well in backtesting but fail miserably in live trading due to market shifts.  Before deploying any automated system, rigorous backtesting with out-of-sample data and a thorough understanding of potential biases are absolutely essential.  Quantifying your win/loss ratio using a robust methodology, not just gut feeling, is paramount to assessing the actual efficacy of your AI-powered scalping strategy.  The inherent risk in crypto trading remains, regardless of the tools used."

2025-06-06T02:46:27,0.6586,"I hope we can agree that inflation, by definition, is an increase in the prices of goods and services within an economy.  What this means is that the ""purchasing power"" of the currency of that economy declines.  In other words, $1 will no longer purchase the same amount of goods and services as it did in the past if inflation is causing the price of goods and services to rise.  When you ""convert"" your #BTC into the currency of a country that is experiencing inflation, the purchasing power of your #BTC is also lower and therefore not a hedge against inflation.  The problem is, you don't understand that inflation does not ""devalue"" fiat.  It reduces its purchasing power due to the rising price of goods and services.  Whether you buy those things with fiat or #BTC, your purchasing power still declines because #BTC must be priced in FIAT because it has no true value on its own.

Your comment about it being a VERY basic concept is condescending.  Inflation does not impact the value of a currency, it lowers its purchasing power.  The value of a currency is established versus other global currencies trading in the FOREX market.  The purchasing power of the USD could be declining due to inflation in the US economy, but it could be increasing in value against the Yen.  Try reviewing financial materials and information from non-# #BTC sites, and you'll figure it out and see that it is not a hedge.

Give me another one, please!"

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf Page 4 Section 6

**Bold** my emphasis.

The leads to a fatally flawed design since this transition of the incentive from block rewards will not occur regardless of small blocks (Bitcoin Core) or big blocks (Bitcoin Cash / SV)

Bitcoin is fundamentally flawed in its design as a result and it is only a matter of time before it will fail. A tail emission such as is the case for Monero is an absolute must for security. In Bitcoin in all of its forms this can be accomplised by stopping the halving at the current emission rate of 3.125 BTC / BCH, BSV .. etc. 

As for the Bitcoin blocksize debate both sides have done an excellent job of proving the other side wrong. 

Notice the very weak word 

> **can**

and no evidence or reference to support this. This indicates to me that Satoshi knew right from the start that this was a very critical possible if not likely flaw in the Bitcoin design.

2025-06-06T00:20:52,0.8882,"This move by JPMorgan isn't surprising, given the increasing institutional interest in crypto.  Using crypto-linked assets as collateral opens up new avenues for lending and borrowing within their existing high-net-worth client base.  However, it's crucial to remember that this is *not* a retail-focused initiative.  The minimum investment required to access such services would likely be substantial, and the risk profile associated with this type of collateralization needs to be carefully assessed by both JPMorgan and its clients.

The choice of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust as an initial offering suggests a focus on regulatory compliance and minimizing counterparty risk.  This strategy, while prudent, also limits the range of available crypto assets for collateralization, at least for now.  Future expansion to other, perhaps more volatile, cryptocurrencies will depend heavily on regulatory developments and evolving risk appetite.

Finally, the historical context cited in other comments is valid.  Institutional involvement in crypto has often preceded periods of both significant growth and substantial corrections.  This development should be viewed with cautious optimism, focusing on the underlying fundamentals rather than speculative price movements.  Further analysis of the terms and conditions of these loans, and the risk mitigation strategies employed by JPMorgan, will be crucial for a more complete understanding of the long-term implications."
